    "In SIR dynamics there are multiple absorbing states (every disease-free state is absorbing). Eventually, the Markov process will reach a disease-free state with probability 1. Instead of computing the absorbing time for a disease-free state, we here ask for every $k \\le n$ what is the probability that the Markov process is absorbed in a state with $n-k$ susceptible agents and $k$ recovered agents. This indicates how large the outbreak was.\n",

Actually, the little weight associated to node $(0,0)$ appears to depend on the fact that it has been visited once since it is the starting point of the chain. We guess that when the length on the walk tends to infinity the weight associated to node $(0,0)$ vanishes and the approximation of $\\pi$ is supported and uniformly distributed on $\\{(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1)\\}$."
